PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions

    detailed description here ...
    It is best to list each argument on a separate line
    
    The docstring for a function or method should summarize
    its behavior and document its arguments, return value(s),
    side effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions on when
    it can be called (all if applicable). Optional arguments should be indicated.
    It should be documented whether keyword arguments are part of the interface.
