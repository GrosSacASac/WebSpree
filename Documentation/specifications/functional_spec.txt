Goals:
======
WebSpree is meant to be an app to help beginners with Web related technologies.
Part of the project is to encourage good habits and teach the importance of standards.
It should also give clues to explore further than the app.
HTML and CSS are the first technologies implemented.
JavaScript later.

##Tutorials to create webpages with verification

A tutorial is a document to let the user discover new worlds and build something on his own fast.
To implement a tutorial you need to create a folder with html pages in it. index.html is a must and is considered as the starting point. The user can start a tutorial by clicking on a menu and the select the tutorial.

At index.html you can find an introduction,author,level and more and a link to start. Tutorials can also have a verification. The shape verification takes is not decided yet. Verification allows the tutorial autor to ensure the user tries/writes/experiments while reading the tutorial.

The tutorial support is html so you can include any text,images videos and games.
